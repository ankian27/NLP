#This class is used to generate the defitions for each cluster. The idea of definiton generation is that, we can derive the definition of a word by using the context words neighbouring the target word in a given context. The topics are given by the hdp are used to get the topic words. The topic words along with the target_word(the noun/verb/nameconflate pair) is given as input to the program and the output is a sentence generated using those topic words. The sentence gerneated using our approach adheres to the syntactic structure of the enlgish grammar and is more than 10 words. The syntactic structure of the english grammar is represented here in the form of Context Free Grammars(CFG). A CFG is a set of recursive rules(or productions) which are used to generate string patterns. We give the target word as one of the input because if the target word is present in the set of topic words  we want to remove it from the defintion. The execution of the program is as follows:

# Input : Topic words, Target word
# Output: Sentence depicting the meaning of the target word

# Example: shoot woman love look movie director part lot money film
# Output : money love with a movie and a director love with is lot
