There are currently only limited data regarding the long-term oncological safety and long-term contour benefits of lipofilling for contour regularities after breast reconstruction. Data from comparative studies and case reports suggest that patient satisfaction is good; however, more data are needed before a recommendation for its use can be made. # CONCLUSIONS # To our knowledge, the present analysis is the most comprehensive systematic review to <head>date</head> on breast reconstruction following prophylactic or therapeutic mastectomy. We have presented data to show that breast reconstruction is oncologically safe and improves patient satisfaction and psychosocial well-being. There are many options for breast reconstruction, from the timing of the surgery with respect to mastectomy, to whether autologous tissue, an implant with autologous tissue or an HADM is used.

 Does having a complication necessarily mean an adverse aesthetic outcome? We endeavored to track aesthetic outcomes following implant reconstruction in patients who experienced a complication. # Studies have shown that complications following surgery can negatively impact a patient's health status, extend hospital stays and lead to higher medical bills (23-26). The potential ramifications of complications on local vasculature and wound healing may be of particular importance in the reconstruction population, in which improved aesthetic outcomes enhance a patient's self image and well-being. To <head>date</head>, there has been little investigation into whether complications actually result in poorer cosmetic outcomes in these patients. Previous studies involving reconstruction patients have focused on the overall aesthetics associated with various methods, with some additional analysis of factors that may have contributed significantly to die final cosmetic result (6, 10, 13, 15).

For several reasons, an increasing number of studies have been conducted on reading fluency during the last decade (e.g., Chard, Vaughn, Tyler, 2002; Mokhtari Thompson, 2006). First, fluency involves reading rate and accuracy, and is related to comprehension (Denton et al., 2011). Second, fluency has been considered an indicator of overall reading performance (Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp,  Jenkins, 2001). However, to <head>date</head>, scant attention has been paid to comparing the reading fluency of those with reading disabilities to those without such disabilities (Jenkins, Fuchs, van den Broek, Espin,  Deno, 2003) at the secondary and postsecondary levels.

They too found a strong relationship between fluent, expressive reading and level of silent reading comprehension. # Purpose of the Research # The construct of reading measurement is evolving, but to <head>date</head> fluency has received inadequate attention, especially at the secondary and postsecondary levels. This is a critical void, given the importance of fluency as it relates to reading comprehension.

Further, only 2.8 percent of public library websites (n = 3) provided important health disclaimers.

Overall, this study offers practical guidance for library and information professionals for enhancing consumer health reference services and connecting users to health information in the Affordable Care Act landscape

While previous research has focused on design elements of consumer health websites in academic settings, 27 studies that assess the range of health resources collected and organized on public library websites intended for their library website users are lacking.

It took a moment in the servant's case, but then Hanani at last saw recognition flow across her face. Only then did she add, " I'm Hanani, an apprentice of the Sharer path. " # The servant finally remembered her manners and bobbed her head. " Please come inside, Sharer-Apprentice. " # The house, when they entered its foyer, was far cooler and more comfortable than the late-afternoon swelter without. The foyer opened directly into the family's modest atrium, where small shrubs and plants surrounded a handsome, good-sized <head>date</head> palm. The tree's canopy kept the atrium in striped shade. Beneath this tree, a nest of cushions and blankets had been built. Here reclined a heavyset, graying woman in a deep indigo Kisuati wrap. Her face, Hanani saw when the servant girl went to speak to her, was lined and puffy, the whites of her eyes red from weeping.

As far as the time of birth of Jesus is concerned the only hint we get is from the truest testament. It tells us that it was not in cold weather like that of December. Jesus was born under a <head>date</head> tree and certainly in absolute seclution and out of town.What the Europeans have been celebrating since centuries is in fact Odinmas. In other words they would celebrate this festival as they do today to venerate their Pagan god Odin.

At $27, the duck flirting with Middle Eastern flavours - the sticky, pull-apart braised leg sitting on a puck of cracked wheat has hints of orange and star anise, coriander and cumin seeds - also gets a tick in the value stakes. It's the attention to detail that makes this food standout: the smooth, not too sweet <head>date</head> puree; the orange zest kicker. A warm, comforting prune and walnut frangipane with poached quince arrives cloaked in almond milk froth - very cheffy - although the toasted honey and walnut ice-cream is from Gundowring.

Finally, our staple biryani has a competition. Kerala biryani or the kalam biriyani is here. Those you didn't appreciate the spice and the absence of sweet in the Hyderabadi biryani, Kerala biryani at KK is here to meet those demands. The sweet biryani is a good break which is served with a sweet <head>date</head> pickle, a hat mango pickle and some raita. With two separate kitchens for veg and non-veg cooking there is no reason why ‘pure vegetarians' can frequent this place.

It was hot and except for the people in Medina, the rest of the people there generally possessed a disorienting hardness about them. In a way, this can be strangely charming. On the other hand, our experience at the <head>date</head> plantation showed me a different side. It was calming and reminded me of those romantic poems written by Arab poets. I would love to see more of that side of the country.

Polat Nasibullah, a 24-year-old cyclist, arrived in Medina two days ago en route to the holy city of Mecca to perform the Hajj ritual. Cycling some 6,600 kilometers from his native Russia, Nasibullah was greeted by Saudi boy scouts who presented him with <head>date</head>s -- for which Medina is famous -- along with sweets and water. Nasibullah arrived in the city only days after the arrival in Mecca of Mohamed Bamachan, a Chinese national who also traveled to Saudi Arabia from his home country -- a four-month journey -- by bicycle.

You can continue with your eight-glasses-of-water-a-day routine throughout the night, in order to stay hydrated during the hot summer days. After breaking your fast with <head>date</head>s or water, try having a bowl of soup or salad before munching on your main course. A warm bowl of soup comforts your stomach with fluids and prepares the digestive system for your meal. Take a break if you feel full after that since overeating may cause stomach pain and bloating.
