The output in this file was created by running the following from the 
directory where senseclusters_scorer.sh resides

senseclusters_scorer.sh random-demo/random10.txt keys/senseinduction.key

mv *.out random-demo

The random answer files were generated as follows....

perl randgen.pl ../keys/senseinduction.key > randomX.txt

where X is the value of upperlimit, where upperlimit is set in randgen 
and determines the number of random clusters per word
