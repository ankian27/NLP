There is no installation necessary. All of the required packages are either in /scratch, or on akka which are accessible by anyone. To do a full run:
1) Sign in to akka
2) navigate to /scratch/NLP_red
	cd /scratch/NLP_red
3) Start up the python virtual environment by executing the command
	source bin/activate.csh
4) Navigate to the project directory
	cd /scratch/NLP_red/NLP/stage2
5) Execute the command
	python cluster_baseline.py

This will run clustering on all of the files in the input directory and the output will be in the OUTPUT directory.
