There is no installation necessary. All of the required packes are either in /scratch, or /home/csugrads/pauls658/ which are accessible by anyone. To do a full run:

1) navigate to /scratch/NLP_red
	cd /scratch/NLP_red
2) Start up the python virtual environment. Execute the command
	source bin/activate.csh
3) navigate to the project directory
	cd /scratch/NLP_red/NLP/stage2
4) execute the command
	python cluster_baseline.py

This will run clustering on all of the file in the input directory
