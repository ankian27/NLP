OVERALL PERFORMANCE
-------------------
Out the 14 total data sets, our clustering passed the base line for 11 of them. 8 out the 14 were had over 70% recall/precision, and 5 out 14 had better than 80% precision/recall. In stage 1, we had 11 out of 13 break the base line, 6 out 13 break 70%, and 2 out 13 break 80%. Some notable differences between the two are:
- From the perspecitive of breaking baseline, topic modeling seems to perform more reliably. While both methods failed to break baseline on strike and abandon, the first method performed decently on line (recall: 69%), but our second method did poorly (recall: 39%). 
- Our stage 2 implementation excelled more often than stage 1 according to the number of words that exceeded 80% recall
Our stage 2 results generally matched the stage 1 results or considerably outperformed it with the exception of the pigeon-car data and the line data. We believe this is because the approach in stage 2 excels on "easier" words. For example, the word "wear" has two senses: 1) having a piece of clothing on, and 1) damaging slowly over time. The second sense is very often proceeded by the word "tear", and the first sense nearly always has a reference to a piece of clothing. While topic modeling did fairly well on wear (recall: 80%), it could not recognize that different items of clothing are related, so it initially gave us 2 clusters for the first sense. We can see this if we look back at the topic words for wear in stage 1. Cluster 0 has shirt, uniform, and dress as topic words, and cluster 2 has these same topic words, but it also has shoes. Because topic modeling couldn't infer the relationship between shoes and the other items of clothing, it created this cluster 2. This was a theme throughout our topic modeling approach, and we had to solve it by manually combining clusters with overlapping topic words. Manually combining clusters based on topic word overlap also had limitations though since we were still limited in our knowledge of the relationships between specific words.
Representing words and contexts as vectors in stage 2 made this inference possible. The word embedding approach was able to accurately infer the relationship between different items of clothing without any manual clustering. In addition, we knew that frequently occuring words were often indicative of a sense, and we were able to include this information in our cluster by weighting word vectors with a tfidf-like weight. Looking at the word vectors in the OUTPUT file, we can see that tear was consistently the highest weighted word for all of our contexts. This was not possible (or at least no obvious way presented itself to us) with topic modeling.

BEST PERFORMANCE
----------------
The best performing word for stage 2 was the sidewalk-furnace conflate pair with a recall of 88.17%. We believe the clustering performed well for the same reason that our word wear performed well. Both sidewalk and furnace are generally used in one distinct context each, so there are often a few, frequent keywords that "give away" the sense. As previously mentioned, we generally assign higher weights to frequent words, so our approach capitalizes on these few and frequent keywords. The word sidewalk is often used when discussing something pertaining to an urban environment, and the word furnace is often used when discussing things pertaining to metal working. 
In the output file, we printed out the top 10 words for each cluster. Examining these top words reveals that this is indeed the case. Street, city, road, traffic, pedestrian, and avenue were among the top 10 words for sidewalk, and iron, blast, steel, temperature, and heat were among the top 10 words for furnace.

Correct assignments
-------------------
1) This is again confirmed by examining a few of the context vectors used for clustering. For the furnace cluster, we see that instance 1176 was assigned to the correct cluster. Examining the context words and the weights for each word, we can see why it was placed in the furnace cluster. The words iron, blast, coal, and ore were all included in this context's vector with very high weights. The context words are printed below:
ID: 1176 (iron,11.7096445795) (blast,11.08790779) (pig,10.4419369242) (coal,10.3713507356) (ore,10.3432771035) (ore,10.3432771035) (bottom,8.78912741905) (mill,8.64505211954) (limestone,8.4248025209) (rolling,8.27738675754) (due,7.92815233691) (melt,7.19735950535) (huge,6.86545331511) (bars,6.46346110016) (crowbars,4.40023481279)
2) For the sidewalk cluster, we see that instance 1167 Was correctly assigned. The reason is similar to the previous example. We note though that the sidewalk sense was probably more difficult to detect than the furnace sense. In the furnace sense, each context generally had several words which indicated the correct sense, however the sidewalk sense usually only had one or two words which strongly indicated a sense. In instance 1167, those words were city and house. The weighting helped to offset the lack of indicative words though. Looking at the context words, we see that city and house had the highest weights. 
ID: 1167 (city,10.5795628274) (houses,8.1129807746) (plants,7.92815233691) (passed,7.718389155) (fine,6.86545331511) (opera,5.30836381271) (enter,5.30836381271) (chorus,4.40023481279) (royal,4.40023481279) (diversified,2.98489715885) (conservatory,2.98489715885) (peasantry,2.98489715885) (fro,2.98489715885) (pasturage,2.98489715885)

Incorrect assignments
---------------------
1) For sidewalk-furnace, words were incorrectly assigned often due to the imperfect nature of affinity propogation. In the case of instance 997, we clearly had context words which were strongly related to the top words of the sidewalk sense, however it was put in the furnace cluster because affinity propogation was not perfect. When we compare the top 10 words of the sidewalk cluster to the context words used for instance 997, we can clearly see it should be more similar to the sidewalk sense. Instance 997 has 3 context words (city, roads, houses) which overlap with the top 10 words of the sidewalk cluster.
ID: 997 (city,10.5795628274) (buildings,9.65658647108) (roads,9.60537342397) (problem,8.76184696944) (wood,8.59784828973) (wood,8.59784828973) (houses,8.1129807746) (chicago,7.6050299468) (tar,5.30836381271) (rain,5.30836381271) (topped,4.40023481279) (highly,4.40023481279) (shingle,4.40023481279) (inch,4.40023481279) (flammable,2.98489715885)
2) The other case where words were incorrectly assigned was because we didn't have enough context words. This was the case for both instance 273 and instance 1143. These words were assigned to their own separate cluster.

AVERAGE PERFORMANCE
-------------------
Our recalls ranged from 39% to 88%. Our bat instances performed in the middle with 61%. This is slightly better than our stage 1 results. In stage 1, topic modeling had trouble detecting more than one sense of the word, putting 98 instances into 1 cluster, and the remaining 2 into another cluster. In stage 2 our results were more distributed, with 3 clusters of size 43, 48, and 9. The actual two senses appear in the second and third clusters, but our clustering method seems to have discovered a third sense related to houses and body parts. Some of the top words for the first cluster are hand, house, room, and arms. None of the top words for this cluster indicate either of the two senses of bat. We hypothesize this is because the two senses are not always used in distinct contexts like sidewalk and furnace. For example, the animal sense of bat is used in the phrase "bat out of hell", which has no correlations with contexts where the mammal itself is being discussed. In addition, the piece of sports equipment bat isn't always used in contexts discussing baseball. Still, many of our contexts involved discussing baseball or discussing mammals, so we were able to group some of the contexts well.

Correct Assignments
-------------------
We consider clusters 2 and 3 to be the actual clusters because their top words indicate one of the senses of bat.
1) Contexts that were discussing baseball usually clustered well. For example, instance  was correctly placed in the sports equipment sense because of it's context words. In particular, our clustering found that the word game is strongly associated with a sense. We can see this in examining instance 97. The word game has the highest weight.
ID: 97 (game,5.14397734946) (game,5.14397734946) (contact,4.57420326503) (ball,4.57420326503) (catch,4.2647231241) (baseball,4.09074873796) (consecutive,3.24184167477) (evolved,3.24184167477) (difference,3.24184167477) (fly,2.25403246174) (balls,2.25403246174) (won,2.25403246174) (surprisingly,2.25403246174) (include,2.25403246174) (football,2.25403246174)
2) Several of our mammal sense contexts discussed bats in a biological context. These contexts usually contained the word species and viruses, which lead to the creation of cluster 3. Looking at all of the contexts words for instances placed in cluster 3, we see that species and virus appeared in all of these. Instance 5 is shown below.
ID: 5 (species,4.81365671032) (host,4.09074873796) (host,4.09074873796) (genetic,3.24184167477) (low,3.24184167477) (form,3.24184167477) (two,3.24184167477) (system,3.24184167477) (diversity,2.25403246174) (bottleneck,2.25403246174) (mammal,2.25403246174) (infected,2.25403246174) (intermittently,2.25403246174) (bitten,2.25403246174) (insect,2.25403246174)

Incorrect assignments
---------------------
Incorrect assignments only occurred in clusters 1 and 2. The main reason for incorrect assigments is the versatile use of the bat for both senses.
1) Instance 0 was incorrectly clustered because it is using bat in the phrase "bat out of hell". This phrase is versatile in the way that it can be used in discussing many topics. We can see from the context words that nothing indicated the mammal sense.
ID: 0 (need,4.57420326503) (hell,4.57420326503) (small,4.57420326503) (reach,3.84663441849) (highway,3.24184167477) (drive,3.24184167477) (rain,3.24184167477) (form,3.24184167477) (bouncing,3.24184167477) (motorcar,2.25403246174) (salesman,2.25403246174) (miles,2.25403246174) (hour,2.25403246174) (sold,2.25403246174) (imagine,2.25403246174)
2) Similarly, bat is also used in the mammal sense for metaphors. Instance 12 is an example of this. In 12, a scruffy man with black eyes is being compared to a bat in a cave. This is an uncommon way of using bat in the mammal sense, so our algorithm doesn't know where to put it.
ID: 12 (red,4.81365671032) (small,4.57420326503) (nose,4.57420326503) (eyes,4.46580426352) (black,4.2647231241) (looked,4.2647231241) (face,3.84663441849) (arms,3.84663441849) (cave,3.24184167477) (huge,3.24184167477) (skin,2.25403246174) (showing,2.25403246174) (peering,2.25403246174) (hair,2.25403246174) (terrific,2.25403246174)

WORST PERFORMANCE
-----------------
The worst performing word both relative to the baseline and in terms of recall was the line data. Only one of our clusters consistently captures a single sense, specifically the product sense, and this cluster only contains about 1/5 of all the instances that were the product sense. This cluster was created from the line instances that discussed a line of ibm computers. We say this because the word 'ibm' appears 234 times and 'computers' appears 218 times. As mentioned before, our algorithm tends to cluster based on words that occur frequently because they often indicate a sense. Even though this worked for part of line's product sense, this technique did not fair well for anything else. Our other clusters contain a wide mix of all the other senses. We consider this partial cluster of the product sense to be the only correct cluster.

Correct Assignments
-------------------
The clusters that were assigned correctly were the ones referring to a line of computers. The instances in this cluster were grouped together primarily because they all had words like 'ibm' and 'computers' in them. We can see how these words often appear together by examing some of the instances of the product sense. Instance 3709 discusses ibm's earnings on a specific line of computer that they sell.

<s> But IBM posted an earnings gain of 39%; the rise was just 8% after adjusting the year-earlier results for a restructuring charge and a gain on a sale. </s> <@> <s> IBM had its first significant revenue g      ain in the U.S. in years, and got a strong performance from its AS/400 minicomputer  <head>line</head>  -- which wasn't yet introduced a year earlier. </s>

We can see the same pattern in instance 3552.

 <s> Yesterday, IBM stock rose 12.5 cents to close at $116.125 a share, while Baxter International common closed unchanged at $22.25, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </s> <@> </p> <@> <p> <      @> <s> Separately, IBM announced that it had authorized the opening of 41 new dealerships that will sell its PS/2 personal computer  <head>line</head> , marking the end of a moratorium it declared four years       ago. </s>

In addition, if we look at the context words used for clustering, we can see that the words ibm, computer, and other related words had the highest weights.

Incorrect Assignments
---------------------
Other instances which discussed companies or computers were incorrectly assigned to cluster 2. For example, instance 4095 is discussing a magazine company, and the word company appears several times. When using the product sense of line, a company is often referenced (and therefore the word company is used). This is likely why 4095 was put in the product cluster.

<s> After a slick redesign, the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company, Keizaikai Corp., the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services, book publi      shing and a tourist agency. </s> <@> <s> Printed in the U.S. and carrying the  <head>line</head>  "The Insider's Japan," Business Tokyo's October cover story was "The World's No. 1 Customer" -- Japanese wome      n. </s>

ID: 4095 (business,13.1349115951) (services,12.0969964716) (women,11.9192475865) (include,11.8816592221) (financial,11.2832036449) (japanese,11.1776500904) (customer,11.0543252436) (agency,10.9025156879) (japan,10.8898095392) (publishing,10.2070951387) (cover,10.1692985767) (book,9.90560974132) (story,9.68429408129) (october,9.41234720539) (tokyo,9.09891495323)

Instance 4049 was also a text sense which was clustered with the product senses. 4049 discusses a court case document which, to a human, would strongly suggest the text sense. However, our algorithm probably put it in the product sense because of the strong weight we put on the word computer.

<s> Philip Reiss, an attorney for WPP, said the memo was found late Tuesday in the files of several of the departed directors. </s> <@> </p> <@> <p> <@> <s> The document, which appears to be a computer print      out and isn't dated, has a  <head>line</head>  at the top stating it is from Ed Yaconetti, the former chief operating officer of Lord Geller, to the agency's management committee. </s>

=====================
DEFINITION GENERATION
=====================

Method:
-------

Our previous approach to definition generation was to select the topic word that hdp-wsi gave us. The we used CFG rules to make a sentence that was our definition for it. Since in the stage-2 of our project, we use Word2Vec model for our clustering and not hdp-wsi. We decided  to use the vector addition feature of Word2Vec. Our intention was to pick upto 5 highest occuring Nouns, Adjectives and Verbs from context generated for every sense cluster generated for each word, and then generate the definition.

Our definition has two parts now, The first part is a mostly hardcoded sentence that tries to use the hypernym(ideally) of the highest occuring 5 nouns(or less if there are not enough nouns). We did this to get the overall meaning of the word and use it in the definition. For example the definition of 'dog' given as an example had the word 'canine' in it which is actually a hypernym for 'dog' just like the word 'hound' . Then the second part is similar to our approach in the stage-1 of our project. We use some of the highest occuring words(Nouns, Adjectives and Verbs) and make a sentence from it using CFG rules. 

Vector addition and subtraction of words could be used to get different Hypernyms or Hyponyms of those words. We wanted to add the top nouns that we got to get their hypernym, so that it could be used in the first half of the definition, the reason for this is explained in the previous paragraph.

Initially we were using all the words from the clusters towards the total frequency counts. This gave us slightly poor results as some instances had multiple occurences of an irrelevant word, and that word was being selected as our top word for the vector summation. An example of this is the word 'colbert' in one cluster of the word 'wear'. It was occuring 4 times in one instance and hence was one of the most occurring noun, but was totally irrelevant. So we got an idea from the sentiment analysis video, where it was mentioned that he frequency of a word within an instance was irrelevant, the useful piece of information was if that word existed or not. So we decided that the frequency count for each word would be increased by max 1 for each instance. This approach gave us better definitions.

In our clustering results We got varying cluster sizes. In one case the cluster was only two instances so the context words for that cluster didn't have any nouns whatsoever. So it was not possible to generate the word for the first part of the definition through the vector sum process. So the word 'unknown' was used instead, this approach is justified as the cluster with only 2 instances is definitely an erroneous one and therefore that word sense mostly doesn't exist and hence should not have any definition.        

The basic idea for second part of definition generation of a word is to use the context words of the sentence in which the word is used. We use the Context Free Grammars(CFG) to generate the definition of the words. The CFGs have a set of recursively defined rules(productions) to generate string patterns.

The Context Free Grammar Rules used are:

S 	-> S1
S1 	-> NP VP
NP 	-> Det ADJ N
VP 	-> V NP
Det -> a | the | is
N 	-> Noun words list
V 	-> Verb words list
ADJ -> Adjective words list


We use the Context Free Grammar rules to preserve the syntactic structure of the English grammar. The English grammar has rules such as, Noun phrase should be followed by a Verb Phrase, 'a', 'an', 'the' are Determiners and so on. To preserve such rules and to use them during the sentence generation, we use the Context Free Grammars. The CFG rules are recursively applied to the topic words to generate the definition of the topic words. 

Firstly, we derive the Parts of Speech for each of the topic words and then seperate the words into different sets of Noun/Verb/Adjective based on the dervied Parts of Speech tags.

We iterate over each of the symbols(Terminal symbol) and choose a Non-Terminal or Terminal symbol based on the production rule to generate the definition. 

Examples of Terminal Symbols: S, S1,, NP, VP, Det, N, V, ADJ
Non-Terminal Symbols : Nouns, verbs, adjectives, determiners

Example:

Noun Words	: [('gun', 10), 
			   ('rifle', 6), 
			   ('times', 5), 
			   ('deer', 4), 
			   ('guy', 4)]

All the words we looked the definition for had multiple meanings and often the number of definitions given were more than the number of senses we chose for our data creation stage. So we had to select the definition that seemed to be closest to our senses. Then we went through the definitions generated for our clusters and matched it corresponding to the definitions of the two dictionaries as best as we could.

The major difference which can be spotted easily is that the the dictionary definitions were more coherent than ours. For the definitions generated by our systems we used the words that were extracted from the context of the target words. Sometimes these were very accurate and useful but the other times not so much. So using only these words and the vector sums of the top nouns we tried to come up with our structured definitions.

As it can be noted many of them have relevant terms that give us a good idea about what that sense means, but it's just not as specific and spot-on as all the words in dictionary definitions. This however was sort of bound to happen as the instances for a target word contains words that might hint towards the target word but not the words that totally define it. 

For our definitions we have treated the nouns and verb definitions differently. The first part of the definition, that is the hard coded part has different sentence structure for both nouns and verbs definition based upon the general nature of these parts of speeches.

The word vector summation strategy for the first part seemed to be working for most of the definitions as we do get good relevant words, but does not seem to be that effective for some words. The reason being the value of the resultant vector of the sum of the words we are using. If the words that we add are generally similar we get good resultant summation word vector, but if they are not we do get words that are not very representative of our sense. One such interesting example is

Abandon:
Cluster 0:
[('mind', 5), ('mother', 4), ('country', 4), ('despair', 4), ('friends', 4)]
Something you do with unconditional_Cam_Newton. a present country began a generous despair  

Here we get the aforementioned words that when added together give the word 'unconditional_Cam_Newton'. This word seems to be totally unrelated to the sense we are talking about. We do not have much to comment on why the model gives us this result as we can see somehow the resultant vectors of these words point to 'unconditional_Cam_Newton', it's related to the word vector values within that model. In this case it is difficult to speculate why words like mother, country, mind. despair and friends would give us Cam Newton. What we did find was when we looked into the the compound nature of the word, I saw multiple news articles that had a term saying "My love for him is unconditional", Cam Newton said. Since Word2Vec model stores frequently occuring ngrams as compounded word vectors it did so with the Cam Newton instance here as it might have been trained on those news articles.  

-------------------------------------------------
Performance Evaluation (Best, Average and Worst):
-------------------------------------------------

BEST Performing: shoot
-----------------------
C0:
[('film', 12), ('movie', 9), ('lot', 7), ('scene', 5), ('video', 4)]
Something you do with movies. a hour film asked a hour film
C1
[('gun', 10), ('rifle', 6), ('times', 5), ('deer', 4), ('guy', 4)]
Something you do with pistol. the young times kill the dead deer  

I think the verb "shoot" was the best performing in terms of definition generation. The definitions generated clearly differentiate between the two sentences. Our original definitions are:
1.photograph or videograph a scene or a movie
2.Attack with a weapon such as gun, arrow or missile

In cluster 0 : The noun words - film, movie, scene, video all are good context words. By looking at the words itself we can guess something about movies/films. Top 4 out of the 5 nouns imply the same sense. Thus, Word2Vec returned 'movies' as the most similar word. This gave us a clear picture that, given a set of close related words, Word2Vec for sure gives us the most_similar word, related to the same context.

In cluster 1 : The noun words - gun, rifle, deer all incline towards hunting/shooting an animal. Any wild guess can reveal that the word is related to killing an animal with a weapon. Hence the most_similar word returned by Word2Vec is 'pistol' which makes a lot sense. And moreover, it is very close to the definition. 

As it has been mentioned above that the resultant sum vector is only as good as the constituent vectors and it's relevance to our sense depends on how closely the constituent words are related to each other and the sense. The word shoot always had subject words that helped the clustering model to distinguish if the shoot was of a movie/video or from a weapon aimed at an entity. 

Note: The word shoot stands out from the other words we chose, as even in the dictionary definitions it uses words similar to the context words we get from our instances. There are not many words that are used to explain the act of shooting. So because of having less number of words, we get good definition.

Thus, we can say that due to the aforementioned reasons for the target word shoot, we get the best definitions.

AVERAGE Performing:

Wear:
C0:
[('dress', 6), ('shirt', 5), ('uniform', 4), ('kind', 3), ('jeans', 3)]
Something you do with Ralph_Lauren_polo_shirt. a white jeans look a sure kind 

C1
[('tear', 22), ('technology', 3), ('wood', 3), ('study', 3), ('power', 3)]
Something you do with Aluminium_smelting. a tear wood suffer the tear power 

Our original Definitions are:
1.something you put on your body
2.damaged due to regular use

Cluster 0: Although the words, dress, shirt, uniform, jeans indicate clothes, we were not expecting Ralph_Lauren_polo_shirt. Later, we understood that, actually the part of the concatenated word "Ralph_Lauren_polo"_shirt is a brand name which sells clothes, jeans, shoes or stuff that we wear. But in the definition of wear, we meant of something to put on our body. We are expecting this result but found a different one. As mentioned in the discussion section above for Definition Generation in ReadMe, we mentioned that the words that we get from the context of target words only indicate towards the target word but not exactly define it. 

Cluster 1: As the original definition implies, we were looking for words which imply damage due to frequent usage.The relationship between our definition and original definition is farfetched. Because, Aluminium smelting is a process of extracting aluminium from its oxide say aluminium oxide. We hear aluminium oxide in terms of corrosion. The outer layer corrodes but corrosion does not enter into inner layers. We guess this process of corrosion is due to wear and tear. Thus, this relation between 'aluminium' and 'wear and tear' explains the vectos of added upto the most similar word - aluminium smelting. But the later part of definition, wood suffer the tear explains something damaged due to using frequently.


Note: This example reveals one more interesting facts about Word2Vec that, if the word is a brand name, it has a different way to 		  combine it. For example, the brand- Ralph Lauren polo, is concatenated to Ralph_Lauren_polo.
	  We confirm that N-grams of related words(such as brand names) are stored as words concatenated with underscore.

Strike:
C0:
[('tomorrow', 5), ('night', 4), ('zone', 3), ('game', 3), ('arm', 3)]
Something you do with tonight. a white zone think a single tomorrow 
C1:
[('union', 9), ('iran', 4), ('west', 3), ('jobs', 3), ('students', 3)]
Something you do with EMMC_nurses. a nuclear union killed a local iran 

Our original Definitions are:
1.missing a baseball pitch
2.sudden forced hit
3.refusal to work

Cluster 0:
One of the instance (taken as is from the context): "It was Monday night. With luck, and presuming the train workers didn't go on <head>strike</head> between here and Calais, she might be home by this time tomorrow."

As we can see, the words, such as 'night', 'tomorrow' are part of the context. Similarly they were repeated many times in different contexts. Although, the words, 'game', 'arm' may imply hitting, the combination does not produce a good word similar to our context.
But the word 'tonight' is similar to tomorrow and night as returned by the google. It is even hard to draw an inference from the generated definition to the original ones. Hence, we think strike has one of the worst definitions.

Cluster 1:
One of the instance (taken as is from the context): "You know, if you think historically things that union employees have stayed out on a <head>strike</head> longer for -- things like pension benefits, for example, or seniority"

Most of the time the word strike is used in the context of "not willing to work". This word is used if, unions are refusing to work, teachers refusing to strike for not getting a new contract and so on. With the word strike being used in these kind of references, it is hard to get the meaning from them. We think that, although the words, union, iran, west, jobs may some what be related to strike but the word 'students' is altering the context by huge extent. 
The word EMMC_nurses refers to the nurses of Eastern Maine Medical Center (frequently shorted to Eastern Maine or simply EMMC). It is a hospital located in Bangor, Maine. The word, 'west' indicates directions hence the possible inference of choosing 'Eastern'. And our analysis of EMMC in wiki revealed that, in 2010-2012 there were nursing strikes(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Maine_Medical_Center). We then thought that these words may seem related for google vectors but the actual definition of strike is very farly related to it.

In general, the word 'strike' is used in very generalized context. It can be used anywhere where people are not willing to do work and refusing to do any more work. It can be used with students, teachers, job professionals, unions etc. Also the word is used in many different kinds of games baseball, cricket, bowling etc. More over, the word strike is used as a metaphor too. It can be used in terms of lightning (eg. there were lightning strikes yesterday). So these kind of generalized usage of the word gave us contexts and words which are not close enough. All theses contexts were not inclining towards the word meaning itself. Hence we confirm that due to these reasons, the definition for the word STRIKE was one of the worst performing.


Note: Some of the definitions we generated were empty. For example in cluster 2 of sidewalk-furnace name-conflate pair, the definition ----- was:"Something you do with unknown. the a ". This happened for the following reason:
	  When we checked the number of instances in the cluster, there were only 2 instances. And there were no nouns in it. The nouns list was empty([]). Hence there was no good definition generated. And we returned the word 'unknown'
