Gensim Word2Vec:

We use the Gensim implementaion of the Word2Vec for our system:

It is based on the original word2vec implementation at https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ based on the paper by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado and Jeffrey Dean(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf).

We use sci-kit learn's implementaion of affinity propogation for clustering:

Affinity Propogation is a clustering algorithm first developed by Brendan J. Frey and Delbert Dueck in the following paper.
