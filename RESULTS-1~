Best Performing Word|
---------------------
All of the name-conflate pairs performed relatively well because the contexts that they are used in tend to vary much more than the non-name-conflate pair words. The one that performed the best though is the pigeon-car conflate pair. HDP tends to be very fickle because it is non-deterministic, and this conflate pair was not always the best performing word throughout our test-runs; it just happened to be this time. With this in mind, we do not think there is any specific reason that this pair performed better than the others because all of our conflate pairs have the common characteristic that the two chosen words are used in very different contexts. We can tell this is the case by looking at the topic words for each cluster (the word "topic" and "cluster" are interchangeble for us). Generally, the topic words all clearly indicate one sense, though there are some mishaps (Ex: topic 2 has mostly "pigeon" sense topic words, but the "passenger" also made it in there probably because of the phrase "passenger pigeon"). 
As mentioned before, the reason this conflate pair (and in general all of the conflate pairs) performed well is because of the distinct contexts these words appear in, so the HDP was able to find distinct topics and topic words that clearly indicate a unique sense. Since documents are assigned to clusters based which topic's topic words appears most frequently in that document, we end up making good cluster assignments. Take the following document as an example:

in the field or for dollar value -- and splice them into the genome of a stem cell from a common rock pigeon. # Rock <head>p_c</head> stem      cells containing this doctored genome could be transformed into germ    , and I know they are coming in on my frequency led by this

This instance was assigned to topic 1 (before we collapsed it into topics 2, 3, and 4) because the appearances of the words "genome" and "cells" in the context. This also shows why we needed to combine some topics. Because we have several documents for the pigeon sense that are from (or seem to be from) a biology text book, hdp interpreted this as a seperate topic, which translated into another sense.
In general, mis-assignments are due to context words that generally indicate the "car" sense appearing in the pigeon sene. In the following example, "drive" appears in the same context as the pigeon sense, so it is incorrectly assigned to topic 0.

the father of Doux Papa, resting on a bench in front of his and Robin Page, and published by Houghton Mifflin; and Don't let the <head>p_c<     /head> drive the bus, illustrated and written by Mo Willems, and published by Hyperion    build strength and flexibility, and use them on s     hort breaks during epics

After combining some of the topics (as described in the execution outline in the README), we end up with two fairly solid senses which can be seen looking at the topic words. Collapsing similar clusters worked particularly well in this case because the "car" topic did not have any overlap (besides the extraneous "xyz") with the other topics in terms of the topic words. 

----------------------
Worst Performing Word|
----------------------
The word that performed the worst was abandon with a score of 45%. This appears largely to be because of the variety of contexts in which abandon is used, the lack of unique words that identify a particular sense, and HDP's tendency to find more topics than there are senes. In addition, HDP may not be well-suited to perform WSI on small data sets (large being at least 1000). We see that HDP gave us 10 topics, and none of them seem to strongly indicate any of the 4 senses. It did seem to find a few topics that abanon is generally used in however, which unfortunately is not what we wanted. For example, topic 0 shows that there were several documents discussing religion in which the word abandon appeared.
The reason for the mis-assignments is because the context words in a document are not good indicators of the sense of abandon. The sense is much better indicated by the grammatical structure of the sentence, and unfortunately, HDP does not take these characteristics into account. In addition, the different senses of abandon are too similar and have nuanced differences. 

'Well, sir,' returned I, 'I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been     brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.  You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you mu    st treat her kindly.  Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn't     have <head>abandoned</head> the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this,     with you.'
