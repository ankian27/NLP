The only problem with it was that the gatekeepers who controlled it, deciding in advance which astronomers would be able to use the BST, had rejected all my proposals for observational runs on it.

Electromagnetic radiation of a source could be represented as a <head>plot</head> of intensity versus wavelength of radiation, called a blackbody spectrum. An ideal blackbody spectrum was smooth and hill-shaped. Our sun peaked in the visual, and Earth, being cooler, peaked in the infrared.
