So I am no longer immeasur alarm by the prospect of be crossli examin -- especi sinc WITHERINGTON , Q.C. , ha hi brief in despair to a tongue-ti junior , who is incompet to exclaim Bo ! to a goos .

'Well , sir , ' return I , 'I hope you 'll consid that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustom to be look after and wait on ; and that she ha been brought up like an onli daughter , whom everi one wa readi to serv . You must let her have a maid to keep thing tidi about her , and you must treat her kindli . Whatev be your notion of Mr. Edgar , you can not doubt that she ha a capac for strong attach , or she would n't have the eleg , and comfort , and friend of her former home , to fix contentedli , in such a wilder as thi , with you .

I use to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw , and perplex myself to explain satisfactorili whi their conduct wa so opposit in similar circumst . They had both been fond husband , and were both attach to their children ; and I could not see how they should n't both have taken the same road , for good or evil . But , I thought in my mind , Hindley , with appar the stronger head , ha shown himself sadli the wors and the weaker man . When hi ship struck , the captain hi post ; and the crew , instead of tri to save her , rush into riot and confus , leav no hope for their luckless vessel . Linton , on the contrari , display the true courag of a loyal and faith soul : he trust God ; and God comfort him . One hope , and the other despair : they chose their own lot , and were righteous doom to endur them . But you 'll not want to hear my moralis , Mr. Lockwood ; you 'll judg , as well as I can , all these thing : at least , you 'll think you will , and that 's the same . The end of Earnshaw wa what might have been expect ; it follow fast on hi sister 's : there were scarc six month between them . We , at the Grang , never got a veri succinct account of hi state preced it ; all that I did learn wa on occas of go to aid in the prepar for the funer . Mr. Kenneth came to announc the event to my master .
'I 've pray often , ' he half soliloquis , 'for the approach of what is come ; and now I begin to shrink , and fear it . I thought the memori of the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticip that I wa soon , in a few month , or , possibl , week , to be carri up , and laid in it lone hollow ! Ellen , I 've been veri happi with my littl Cathi : through winter night and summer day she wa a live hope at my side . But I 've been as happi muse by myself among those stone , under that old church : lie , through the long June even , on the green mound of her mother 's grave , and wish -- yearn for the time when I might lie beneath it . What can I do for Cathi ? How must I quit her ? I 'd not care one moment for Linton be Heathcliff 's son ; nor for hi take her from me , if he could consol her for my loss . I 'd not care that Heathcliff gain hi end , and triumph in rob me of my last bless ! But should Linton be unworthi -- onli a feebl tool to hi father -- I can not her to him ! And , hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit , I must persever in make her sad while I live , and leav her solitari when I die . Darl ! I 'd rather resign her to God , and lay her in the earth befor me . '
Right is layd asid , either by simpli Renounc it ; or by Transfer it to anoth . By Simpli RENOUNC ; when he care not to whom the benefit thereof redoundeth . By TRANSFER ; when he intendeth the benefit thereof to some certain person , or person . And when a man hath in either manner , or grant away hi Right ; then is he said to be OBLIG , or BOUND , not to hinder those , to whom such Right is grant , or abandon , from the benefit of it : and that he Ought , and it hi DUTi , not to make voyd that voluntari act of hi own : and that such hindranc is INJUSTIC , and INJURi , as be Sine Jure ; the Right be befor renounc , or transfer . So that Injuri , or Injustic , in the controversi of the world , is somewhat like to that , which in the disput of Scholer is call Absurd . For as it is there call an Absurd , to contradict what one maintain in the Begin : so in the world , it is call Injustic , and Injuri , voluntarili to undo that , which from the begin he had voluntarili done . The way by which a man either simpli Renounceth , or Transferreth hi Right , is a Declar , or Signif , by some voluntari and suffici sign , or sign , that he doth so Renounc , or Transferr ; or hath so Renounc , or Transfer the same , to him that accepteth it . And these Sign are either Word one , or Action one ; or ( as it happeneth most often ) both Word and Action . And the same are the BOND , by which men are bound , and oblig : Bond , that have their strength , not from their own Natur , ( for noth is more easili broken then a man word , ) but from Fear of some evil consequ upon the ruptur .
Whensoev a man Transferreth hi Right , or Renounceth it ; it is either in consider of some Right reciproc transfer to himself ; or for some other good he hopeth for therebi . For it is a voluntari act : and of the voluntari act of everi man , the object is some Good To Himself . And therefor there be some Right , which no man can be understood by ani word , or other sign , to have , or transfer . As first a man can not lay down the right of resist them , that assault him by forc , to take away hi life ; becaus he can not be understood to aym therebi , at ani Good to himself . The same may be sayd of Wound , and Chayn , and Imprison ; both becaus there is no benefit consequ to such patienc ; as there is to the patienc of suffer anoth to be wound , or imprison : as also becaus a man can not tell , when he seeth men proceed against him by violenc , whether they intend hi death or not . And lastli the motiv , and end for which thi renounc , and transfer or Right is introduc , is noth els but the secur of a man person , in hi life , and in the mean of so preserv life , as not to be weari of it . And therefor if a man by word , or other sign , seem to despoyl himself of the End , for which those sign were intend ; he is not to be understood as if he meant it , or that it wa hi will ; but that he wa ignor of how such word and action were to be interpret .
Justic And Proprieti Begin With The Constitut of Common-wealth But becaus Coven of mutual trust , where there is a fear of not perform on either part , ( as hath been said in the former Chapter , ) are invalid ; though the Original of Justic be the make of Coven ; yet Injustic actual there can be none , till the caus of such fear be taken away ; which while men are in the natural condit of Warr , can not be done . Therefor befor the name of Just , and Unjust can have place , there must be some coerciv Power , to compel men equal to the perform of their Coven , by the terrour of some punish , greater than the benefit they expect by the breach of their Coven ; and to make good that Proprieti , which by mutual Contract men acquir , in recomp of the universal Right they : and such power there is none befor the erect of a Common-wealth . And thi is also to be gather out of the ordinari definit of Justic in the School : For they say , that `` Justic is the constant Will of give to everi man hi own . '' And therefor where there is no Own , that is , no Proprieti , there is no Injustic ; and where there is no coerceiv Power erect , that is , where there is no Common-wealth , there is no Proprieti ; all men have Right to all thing : Therefor where there is no Common-wealth , there noth is Unjust . So that the natur of Justic , consisteth in keep of valid Coven : but the Valid of Coven begin not but with the Constitut of a Civil Power , suffici to compel men to keep them : And then it is also that Proprieti begin .
In Bodi Politiqu , the power of the Repres is alwai Limit : And that which prescribeth the limit thereof , is the Power Soveraign . For Power Unlimit , is absolut Soveraignti . And the Soveraign , in everi Commonwealth , is the absolut Repres of all the Subject ; and therefor no other , can be Repres of ani part of them , but so far forth , as he shall give leav ; And to give leav to a Bodi Politiqu of Subject , to have an absolut Repres to all intent and purpos , were to the Govern of so much of the Commonwealth , and to divid the Dominion , contrari to their Peac and Defenc , which the Soveraign can not be understood to doe , by ani Grant , that doe not plainli , and directli discharg them of their subject . For consequ of word , are not the sign of hi will , when other consequ are sign of the contrari ; but rather sign of errour , and misreckon ; to which all mankind is too prone .
If a man by the terrour of present death , be compel to doe a fact against the Law , he is total Excus ; becaus no Law can oblig a man to hi own preserv . And suppos such a Law were obligatori ; yet a man would reason thu , `` If I doe it not , I die present ; if I doe it , I die afterward ; therefor by do it , there is time of life gain ; '' Natur therefor compel him to the fact .
In summ , the Power of Excommun can not be extend further than to the end for which the Apostl and Pastor of the Church have their Commiss from our Saviour ; which is not to rule by Command and Coaction , but by Teach and Direct of men in the way of Salvat in the world to come . And as a Master in ani Scienc , may hi Scholar , when hee obstin neglecteth the practis of hi rule ; but not accus him of Injustic , becaus he wa never bound to obey him : so a Teacher of Christian doctrin may abandon hi Discipl that obstin continu in an unchristian life ; but he can not say , they doe him wrong , becaus they are not oblig to obey him : For to a Teacher that shall so complain , may be appli the Answer of God to Samuel in the like place , ( 1 Sam . 8 . ) `` They have not reject thee , but mee . '' Excommun therefor when it wanteth the assist of the Civil Power , as it doth , when a Christian State , or Princ is Excommun by a forain Author , is without effect ; and consequ ought to be without terrour . The name of Fulmen Excommunicationi ( that is , the Thunderbolt Of Excommun ) proceed from an imagin of the Bishop of Rome , which first use it , that he wa King of King , as the Heathen made Jupit King of the God ; and assign him in their Poem , and Pictur , a Thunderbolt , wherewith to subdu , and punish the Giant , that should dare to deni hi power : Which imagin wa ground on two errour ; one , that the Kingdom of Christ is of thi world , contrari to our Saviour own word , `` My Kingdom is not of thi world ; '' the other , that hee is Christ Vicar , not one over hi own Subject , but over all the Christian of the World ; whereof there is no ground in Scriptur , and the contrari shall bee prove in it due place .
And first , to thi Error , That The Present Church Now Milit On Earth , Is The Kingdom Of God , ( that is , the Kingdom of Glori , or the Land of Promis ; not the Kingdom of Grace , which is but a Promis of the Land , ) are annex these worldli Benefit , First , that the Pastor , and Teacher of the Church , are entitl therebi , as God Publiqu Minist , to a Right of Govern the Church ; and consequ ( becaus the Church , and Common-wealth are the same Person ) to be Rector , and Governour of the Common-wealth . By thi titl it is , that the Pope prevail with the subject of all Christian Princ , to beleev , that to disobey him , wa to disobey Christ himself ; and in all differ between him and other Princ , ( charm with the word Power Spiritual , ) to their lawful Soveraign ; which is in effect an universal Monarchi over all Christendom . For though they were first invest in the right of be Suprem Teacher of Christian Doctrin , by , and under Christian Emperor , within the limit of the Roman Empir ( as is acknowledg by themselv ) by the titl of Pontifex Maximu , who wa an Offic subject to the Civil State ; yet after the Empir wa divid , and dissolv , it wa not hard to obtrud upon the peopl alreadi subject to them , anoth Titl , name , the Right of St. Peter ; not one to save entir their pretend Power ; but also to extend the same over the same Christian Provinc , though no more unit in the Empir of Rome . Thi Benefit of an Universal Monarchi , ( consid the desir of men to bear Rule ) is a suffici Presumpt , that the pope that pretend to it , and for a long time enjoy it , were the Author of the Doctrin , by which it wa obtain ; name , that the Church now on Earth , is the Kingdom of Christ . For that grant , it must be understood , that Christ hath some Lieuten amongst us , by whom we are to be told what are hi Command .
Now , when I say that I am in the habit of go to sea whenev I begin to grow hazi about the eye , and begin to be over consciou of my lung , I do not mean to have it infer that I ever go to sea as a passeng . For to go as a passeng you must need have a purs , and a purs is but a rag unless you have someth in it . Besid , passeng get sea-sick -- grow quarrelsom -- do n't sleep of night -- do not enjoy themselv much , as a gener thing ; -- no , I never go as a passeng ; nor , though I am someth of a salt , do I ever go to sea as a Commodor , or a Captain , or a Cook . I the glori and distinct of such offic to those who like them . For my part , I abomin all honour respect toil , trial , and tribul of everi kind whatsoev . It is quit as much as I can do to take care of myself , without take care of ship , barqu , brig , schooner , and what not . And as for go as cook , -- though I confess there is consider glori in that , a cook be a sort of offic on ship-board -- yet , somehow , I never fanci broil fowl ; -- though onc broil , judici butter , and judgmat salt and pepper , there is no one who will speak more respect , not to say reverenti , of a broil fowl than I will . It is out of the idolatr dote of the old Egyptian upon broil ibi and roast river hors , that you see the mummi of those creatur in their huge bake-hous the pyramid .
Though , consum with the hot fire of hi purpos , Ahab in all hi thought and action ever had in view the ultim captur of Mobi Dick ; though he seem readi to sacrific all mortal interest to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he wa by natur and long habitu far too wed to a fieri whaleman 's way , altogeth to the collater prosecut of the voyag . Or at least if thi were otherwis , there were not want other motiv much more influenti with him . It would be refin too much , perhap , even consid hi monomania , to hint that hi vindict toward the White Whale might have possibl extend itself in some degre to all sperm whale , and that the more monster he slew by so much the more he multipli the chanc that each subsequ encount whale would prove to be the hate one he hunt . But if such an hypothesi be inde exception , there were still addit consider which , though not so strictli accord with the wild of hi rule passion , yet were by no mean incap of sway him .
Mr. Erskin wa counsel for the defend ; Lord Ellenborough wa the judg . In the cours of the defenc , the witti Erskin went on to illustr hi posit , by allud to a recent crim . con . case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain tri to bridl hi wife 's vicious , had at last her upon the sea of life ; but in the cours of year , repent of that step , he institut an action to recov possess of her . Erskin wa on the other side ; and he then support it by say , that though the gentleman had origin harpoon the ladi , and had onc had her fast , and onli by reason of the great stress of her plung vicious , had at last abandon her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she becam a loose-fish ; and therefor when a subsequ gentleman re-harpoon her , the ladi then becam that subsequ gentleman 's properti , along with whatev harpoon might have been found stick in her .
These plead , and the counter plead , be duli heard , the veri learn Judg in set term decid , to wit , -- That as for the boat , he award it to the plaintiff , becaus they had mere it to save their live ; but that with regard to the controvert whale , harpoon , and line , they belong to the defend ; the whale , becaus it wa a Loose-Fish at the time of the final captur ; and the harpoon and line becaus when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) acquir a properti in those articl ; and henc anybodi who afterward took the fish had a right to them . Now the defend afterward took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articl were their .

'While we hesit , among the black bush behind us , and dim against their black , I saw three crouch figur . There wa scrub and long grass all about us , and I did not feel safe from their insidi approach . The forest , I calcul , wa rather less than a mile across . If we could get through it to the bare hill-sid , there , as it seem to me , wa an altogeth safer resting-plac ; I thought that with my match and my camphor I could contriv to keep my path illumin through the wood . Yet it wa evid that if I wa to flourish match with my hand I should have to my firewood ; so , rather reluctantli , I put it down . And then it came into my head that I would amaz our friend behind by light it . I wa to discov the atroci folli of thi proceed , but it came to my mind as an ingeni move for cover our retreat .
Thi brought me to a full stop , and if fortun had not again particularli favour me , I should have had to my design . But the light air which had begun blow from the south-east and south had haul round after nightfal into the south-west .

And it wa at thi moment that there occur a most strang and unexpect thing . We had risen from our rock and were turn to go home , have the hopeless chase . The moon wa low upon the right , and the jag pinnacl of a granit tor stood up against the lower curv of it silver disc . There , outlin as black as an eboni statu on that shine background , I saw the figur of a man upon the tor . Do not think that it wa a delus , Holm . I assur you that I have never in my life seen anyth more clearli . As far as I could judg , the figur wa that of a tall , thin man . He stood with hi leg a littl separ , hi arm fold , hi head bow , as if he were brood over that enorm wilder of peat and granit which lay befor him . He might have been the veri spirit of that terribl place . It wa not the convict . Thi man wa far from the place where the latter had disappear . Besid , he wa a much taller man . With a cri of surpris I point him out to the baronet , but in the instant dure which I had turn to grasp hi arm the man wa gone . There wa the sharp pinnacl of granit still cut the lower edg of the moon , but it peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figur .
So far I have been abl to quot from the report which I have forward dure these earli day to Sherlock Holm . Now , howev , I have arriv at a point in my narr where I am compel to thi method and to trust onc more to my recollect , aid by the diari which I kept at the time . A few extract from the latter will carri me on to those scene which are indel fix in everi detail upon my memori . I proceed , then , from the morn which follow our abort chase of the convict and our other strang experi upon the moor .
Ere thi , howev , hi son , style by the French , Henri Fitz-Empress ( that is , son of the empress ) , had pass through other chang of posit and fortun . On the death of hi grandfath , in Decemb 1135 , the English throne had been usurp by Stephen of Bloi , whose mother Adela wa a daughter of the Conqueror : she had been marri to the Earl of Bloi , by whom she had four son , of whom Stephen wa the third . In the cours of the contest that ensu between Stephen and Matilda , young Henri wa in the latter part of the year 1142 entrust by hi father to Robert , Earl of Glocest , hi mother 's illegitim brother and faith partisan , and wa by him brought over to England . They land , the boy and hi uncl , about the middl of Novemb , at Wareham in Dorsetshir , a town and castl belong to the earl , but now held by the king 's troop . The garrison , howev , agre to surrend to Glocest , who had brought with him from the contin a forc of three or four hundr knight , if they should not be reliev within three week ; and soon after , upon be inform from Stephen that he had no intent of reliev them , they gave up the place . Matilda had never , sinc she land in England three year befor , been in such peril as she wa in at thi moment -- not even when , in the summer of the preced year , she wa surpris in London by Stephen 's queen , and onli save herself by spring into her saddl from the tabl at which she wa dine -- nor a few week after when fli from Winchest , earli on a Sunday morn , she and her escort were overtaken by the enemi at Stourbridg , and , while the Earl of Glocest and all the rest were either taken prison or slain , she made her way , attend by a singl follow , to Luggershal , and thenc , after a rest of a few hour , by get again upon horseback and continu her rapid flight , to the castl of Deviz . She wa now shut up in the castl of Oxford , which Stephen besieg with hi whole armi , disregard in the meantim everi other object , and determin to effect it reduct either by forc or famin . All hope seem to be gone ; but , after she had endur the greatest privat , on the night of the 20th of Decemb , she left the castl by a postern gate , with four knight , cross the Thame , which wa frozen over , and reach Abingdon on foot , have walk all the way through a deep snow , and have been enabl to escap the notic of the enemi , some account say , in part by herself and her attend have cloth themselv in white linen . At Abingdon she took hors , and rode to Wallingford Castl . Hither a few day after the Earl of Glocest , have start as soon as he heard the news , brought her her son . The sight of the boy , say an old chronicl , made her forget all her toil and danger , and think all she had suffer noth . Matilda , with all her haughti of temper , wa not without other good qualiti , besid her share in the intrepid and tough invinc spirit of her race ; if prosper made her insol and tyrann , she bore advers admir ; and to her son she wa from the first to the last the best of mother , not onli in the affect she bore him , but in all other respect . Henri wa soon after thi carri to Bristol , and `` continu there four year , '' say Lord Lyttelton , `` under the care of hi uncl , who train him up in such exercis as were most proper to form hi bodi for war , and in those studi which might embellish and strengthen hi mind . The Earl of Glocest himself had no inconsider tinctur of learn , and wa the patron of all who excel in it ; qualiti rare at all time in a nobleman of hi high rank , but particularli in an age when knowledg and valour were thought incompat , and not to be abl to read wa a mark of nobil . Thi truli great man broke through that cloud of barbar ignor , and , after the exampl of hi father King Henri , enlarg hi understand and human hi mind by a commerc with the muse , which he assidu cultiv , even in court and camp , show by hi conduct how use it wa both to the statesman and gener . The same love of scienc and literatur he likewis infus into hi nephew , who under hi influenc began to acquir what he never afterward lost , an ardour for studi and a knowledg of book not to be found in ani other princ of those time . Inde the four year he now pass in England laid the foundat of all that wa afterward most excel in him ; for hi earliest impress were taken from hi uncl , who , not onli in learn but in all other perfect -- in magnanim , valour , prudenc , and all moral virtu , -- wa the best exampl that could be propos to hi imit . `` [ 1 ] Henri 's father , who after a long contest had now acquir complet possess of Normandi , recal hi son from England in the latter part of the year 1146 ; and in the begin of Novemb of that year , veri soon after he had part with hi nephew , the Earl of Glocest wa carri off by a fever . Thi wa to hi sister the empress the loss of her right hand . `` Courag and resent , '' we quot again Lord Lyttelton 's account , `` still combat in her heart with despair ; nor wa it without the greatest and most pain reluct that she gave way to the necess of leav a countri over which she had so long expect to reign . But , in less than four month after the death of her brother , see no possibl of support her parti , and fear to fall into the hand of her enemi , she wa constrain to England and go into Normandi , to live with a husband whom she never had love , and who did not love her , but wa gener or prudent enough to receiv her with kind in thi declin of her fortun , when her pride wa humbl by her sorrow . Nevertheless , he retain to himself the dominion of that duchi , as he had held it in her absenc ; that is , without ani depend upon her . Instead of submit to thi , she would perhap have stay in England , and buri herself under the ruin of her own great , if the anguish of her mind had not been sooth by the hope that Princ Henri , her son , might , when he should attain to an age of matur , be abl to reveng her on Stephen , and recov the crown which she had lost . Her whole care wa therefor employ upon hi educ . She labour to inspir him with thought as high as her own ; to give him an ardour for glori , an ambit for empir , and a spirit of conquest . Hi geniu wa veri suitabl for such instruct ; but the fire he drew from her wa happili temper with the lesson of prudenc and human which he had been taught in England by hi uncl ; and which hi father , a princ of great discret and judgment , continu to fix in hi mind . `` [ 2 ]
Strang as were the principl or ground upon which Edward advanc hi claim to the French crown , hi mean of enforc it seem at least proport inadequ , and hi chanc of success still more slight and visionari . It wa not a case of the head of two great nation parti , divid between them the adher and support of the commun . Edward had no parti in Franc ; the kingdom the success to which wa disput wa wholli with hi oppon . The English crown had even been strip in the cours of the last centuri and a half of the greater part of the territori which it ancient possess in Franc . Bretagn , Normandi , Anjou , Main , and Tourain had all been wrest from it in the disastr reign of John ; and the loss of Poitou had follow in that of hi equal unfortun son Henri III . Of all the vast continent possess of that great king the second Henri , there remain onli the Duchi of Aquitain or Guienn ; and even that had fallen more than onc into the hand of the French monarch , and the preval popular feel wa probabl alreadi more French than English . Edward 's bold project , therefor , wa noth less than to effect the conquest of Franc by the sole forc of England ; and that , too , while he had alreadi upon hi hand the war with Scotland , the object of which wa also the subjug of that kingdom , and the annex of it crown to hi own . The latter scheme , inde , he found himself oblig to soon after he had involv himself in hi contest with Franc . But Scotland continu , nevertheless , for a time to divid hi attent , if not hi ambit ; and at least , it may be said , to occupi hi left arm .
I have alreadi acquaint the reader with the time and place of my birth . My father , besid mani slave , had a numer famili , of which seven live to grow up , includ myself and a sister , who wa the onli daughter . As I wa the youngest of the son , I becam , of cours , the greatest favourit with my mother , and wa alway with her ; and she use to take particular pain to form my mind . I wa train up from my earliest year in the art of war ; my daili exercis wa shoot and throw javelin ; and my mother adorn me with emblem , after the manner of our greatest warrior . In thi way I grew up till I wa turn the age of eleven , when an end wa put to my happi in the follow manner : -- Gener when the grown peopl in the neighbourhood were gone far in the field to labour , the children assembl togeth in some of the neighbour ' premis to play ; and commonli some of us use to get up a tree to look out for ani assail , or kidnapp , that might come upon us ; for they sometim took those opportun of our parent ' absenc to attack and carri off as mani as they could seiz . One day , as I wa watch at the top of a tree in our yard , I saw one of those peopl come into the yard of our next neighbour but one , to kidnap , there be mani stout young peopl in it . Immedi on thi I gave the alarm of the rogu , and he wa surround by the stoutest of them , who entangl him with cord , so that he could not escap till some of the grown peopl came and secur him . But ala ! ere long it wa my fate to be thu attack , and to be carri off , when none of the grown peopl were nigh . One day , when all our peopl were gone out to their work as usual , and onli I and my dear sister were left to mind the hous , two men and a woman got over our wall , and in a moment seiz us both , and , without give us time to cri out , or make resist , they stop our mouth , and ran off with us into the nearest wood . Here they tie our hand , and continu to carri us as far as they could , till night came on , when we reach a small hous , where the robber halt for refresh , and spent the night . We were then unbound , but were unabl to take ani food ; and , be quit overpow by fatigu and grief , our onli relief wa some sleep , which allay our misfortun for a short time . The next morn we left the hous , and continu travel all the day . For a long time we had kept the wood , but at last we came into a road which I believ I knew . I had now some hope of be deliv ; for we had advanc but a littl way befor I discov some peopl at a distanc , on which I began to cri out for their assist : but my cri had no other effect than to make them tie me faster and stop my mouth , and then they put me into a larg sack . They also stop my sister 's mouth , and tie her hand ; and in thi manner we proceed till we were out of the sight of these peopl . When we went to rest the follow night they offer us some victual ; but we refus it ; and the onli comfort we had wa in be in one anoth 's arm all that night , and bath each other with our tear . But ala ! we were soon depriv of even the small comfort of weep togeth . The next day prove a day of greater sorrow than I had yet experienc ; for my sister and I were then separ , while we lay clasp in each other 's arm . It wa in vain that we besought them not to part us ; she wa torn from me , and immedi carri away , while I wa left in a state of distract not to be describ . I cri and griev continu ; and for sever day I did not eat ani thing but what they forc into my mouth . At length , after mani day travel , dure which I had often chang master , I got into the hand of a chieftain , in a veri pleasant countri . Thi man had two wive and some children , and they all use me extrem well , and did all they could to comfort me ; particularli the first wife , who wa someth like my mother . Although I wa a great mani day journey from my father 's hous , yet these peopl spoke exactli the same languag with us . Thi first master of mine , as I may call him , wa a smith , and my princip employ wa work hi bellow , which were the same kind as I had seen in my vicin . They were in some respect not unlik the stove here in gentlemen 's kitchen ; and were cover over with leather ; and in the middl of that leather a stick wa fix , and a person stood up , and work it , in the same manner as is done to pump water out of a cask with a hand pump . I believ it wa gold he work , for it wa of a love bright yellow colour , and wa worn by the women on their wrist and ancl . I wa there I suppos about a month , and they at last use to trust me some littl distanc from the hous . Thi liberti I use in embrac everi opportun to inquir the way to my own home : and I also sometim , for the same purpos , went with the maiden , in the cool of the even , to bring pitcher of water from the spring for the use of the hous . I had also remark where the sun rose in the morn , and set in the even , as I had travel along ; and I had observ that my father 's hous wa toward the rise of the sun . I therefor determin to seiz the first opportun of make my escap , and to shape my cours for that quarter ; for I wa quit oppress and weigh down by grief after my mother and friend ; and my love of liberti , ever great , wa strengthen by the mortifi circumst of not dare to eat with the free-born children , although I wa mostli their companion . While I wa project my escap , one day an unlucki event happen , which quit disconcert my plan , and put an end to my hope . I use to be sometim employ in assist an elderli woman slave to cook and take care of the poultri ; and one morn , while I wa feed some chicken , I happen to toss a small pebbl at one of them , which hit it on the middl and directli kill it . The old slave , have soon after miss the chicken , inquir after it ; and on my relat the accid ( for I told her the truth , becaus my mother would never suffer me to tell a lie ) she flew into a violent passion , threaten that I should suffer for it ; and , my master be out , she immedi went and told her mistress what I had done . Thi alarm me veri much , and I expect an instant flog , which to me wa uncommonli dread ; for I had seldom been beaten at home . I therefor resolv to fli ; and accordingli I ran into a thicket that wa hard by , and hid myself in the bush . Soon afterward my mistress and the slave return , and , not see me , they search all the hous , but not find me , and I not make answer when they call to me , they thought I had run away , and the whole neighbourhood wa rais in the pursuit of me . In that part of the countri ( as in our ) the hous and villag were skirt with wood , or shrubberi , and the bush were so thick that a man could readili conceal himself in them , so as to elud the strictest search . The neighbour continu the whole day look for me , and sever time mani of them came within a few yard of the place where I lay hid . I then gave myself up for lost entir , and expect everi moment , when I heard a rustl among the tree , to be found out , and punish by my master : but they never discov me , though they were often so near that I even heard their conjectur as they were look about for me ; and I now learn from them , that ani attempt to return home would be hopeless . Most of them suppos I had fled toward home ; but the distanc wa so great , and the way so intric , that they thought I could never reach it , and that I should be lost in the wood . When I heard thi I wa seiz with a violent panic , and myself to despair . Night too began to approach , and aggrav all my fear . I had befor entertain hope of get home , and I had determin when it should be dark to make the attempt ; but I wa now convinc it wa fruitless , and I began to consid that , if possibl I could escap all other anim , I could not those of the human kind ; and that , not know the way , I must perish in the wood . Thu wa I like the hunt deer :
The first object which salut my eye when I arriv on the coast wa the sea , and a slave ship , which wa then ride at anchor , and wait for it cargo . These fill me with astonish , which wa soon convert into terror when I wa carri on board . I wa immedi handl and toss up to see if I were sound by some of the crew ; and I wa now persuad that I had gotten into a world of bad spirit , and that they were go to kill me . Their complexion too differ so much from our , their long hair , and the languag they spoke , ( which wa veri differ from ani I had ever heard ) unit to confirm me in thi belief . Inde such were the horror of my view and fear at the moment , that , if ten thousand world had been my own , I would have freeli part with them all to have exchang my condit with that of the meanest slave in my own countri . When I look round the ship too and saw a larg furnac or copper boil , and a multitud of black peopl of everi descript chain togeth , everi one of their counten express deject and sorrow , I no longer doubt of my fate ; and , quit overpow with horror and anguish , I fell motionless on the deck and faint . When I recov a littl I found some black peopl about me , who I believ were some of those who brought me on board , and had been receiv their pay ; they talk to me in order to cheer me , but all in vain . I ask them if we were not to be eaten by those white men with horribl look , red face , and loos hair . They told me I wa not ; and one of the crew brought me a small portion of spiritu liquor in a wine glass ; but , be afraid of him , I would not take it out of hi hand . One of the black therefor took it from him and gave it to me , and I took a littl down my palat , which , instead of reviv me , as they thought it would , threw me into the greatest constern at the strang feel it produc , have never tast ani such liquor befor . Soon after thi the black who brought me on board went off , and left me to despair . I now saw myself depriv of all chanc of return to my nativ countri , or even the least glimps of hope of gain the shore , which I now consid as friendli ; and I even wish for my former slaveri in prefer to my present situat , which wa fill with horror of everi kind , still heighten by my ignor of what I wa to undergo . I wa not long suffer to indulg my grief ; I wa soon put down under the deck , and there I receiv such a salut in my nostril as I had never experienc in my life : so that , with the loathsom of the stench , and cri togeth , I becam so sick and low that I wa not abl to eat , nor had I the least desir to tast ani thing . I now wish for the last friend , death , to reliev me ; but soon , to my grief , two of the white men offer me eatabl ; and , on my refus to eat , one of them held me fast by the hand , and laid me across I think the windlass , and tie my feet , while the other flog me sever . I had never experienc ani thing of thi kind befor ; and although , not be use to the water , I natur fear that element the first time I saw it , yet nevertheless , could I have got over the net , I would have jump over the side , but I could not ; and , besid , the crew use to watch us veri close who were not chain down to the deck , lest we should leap into the water : and I have seen some of these poor African prison most sever cut for attempt to do so , and hourli whip for not eat . Thi inde wa often the case with myself . In a littl time after , amongst the poor chain men , I found some of my own nation , which in a small degre gave eas to my mind . I inquir of these what wa to be done with us ; they gave me to understand we were to be carri to these white peopl 's countri to work for them . I then wa a littl reviv , and thought , if it were no wors than work , my situat wa not so desper : but still I fear I should be put to death , the white peopl look and act , as I thought , in so savag a manner ; for I had never seen among ani peopl such instanc of brutal cruelti ; and thi not onli shewn toward us black , but also to some of the white themselv . One white man in particular I saw , when we were permit to be on deck , flog so unmerci with a larg rope near the foremast , that he die in consequ of it ; and they toss him over the side as they would have done a brute . Thi made me fear these peopl the more ; and I expect noth less than to be treat in the same manner . I could not help express my fear and apprehens to some of my countrymen : I ask them if these peopl had no countri , but live in thi hollow place ( the ship ) : they told me they did not , but came from a distant one . 'Then , ' said I , 'how come it in all our countri we never heard of them ? ' They told me becaus they live so veri far off . I then ask where were their women ? had they ani like themselv ? I wa told they had : 'and whi , ' said I , 'do we not see them ? ' they answer , becaus they were left behind . I ask how the vessel could go ? they told me they could not tell ; but that there were cloth put upon the mast by the help of the rope I saw , and then the vessel went on ; and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the water when they like in order to stop the vessel . I wa exceedingli amaz at thi account , and realli thought they were spirit . I therefor wish much to be from amongst them , for I expect they would sacrific me : but my wish were vain ; for we were so quarter that it wa imposs for ani of us to make our escap . While we stay on the coast I wa mostli on deck ; and one day , to my great astonish , I saw one of these vessel come in with the sail up . As soon as the white saw it , they gave a great shout , at which we were amaz ; and the more so as the vessel appear larger by approach nearer . At last she came to an anchor in my sight , and when the anchor wa let go I and my countrymen who saw it were lost in astonish to observ the vessel stop ; and were not convinc it wa done by magic . Soon after thi the other ship got her boat out , and they came on board of us , and the peopl of both ship seem veri glad to see each other . Sever of the stranger also shook hand with us black peopl , and made motion with their hand , signifi I suppos we were to go to their countri ; but we did not understand them . At last , when the ship we were in had got in all her cargo , they made readi with mani fear nois , and we were all put under deck , so that we could not see how they manag the vessel . But thi disappoint wa the least of my sorrow . The stench of the hold while we were on the coast wa so intoler loathsom , that it wa danger to remain there for ani time , and some of us had been permit to stay on the deck for the fresh air ; but now that the whole ship 's cargo were confin togeth , it becam absolut pestilenti . The close of the place , and the heat of the climat , ad to the number in the ship , which wa so crowd that each had scarc room to turn himself , almost suffoc us . Thi produc copiou perspir , so that the air soon becam unfit for respir , from a varieti of loathsom smell , and brought on a sick among the slave , of which mani die , thu fall victim to the improvid avaric , as I may call it , of their purchas . Thi wretch situat wa again aggrav by the gall of the chain , now becom insupport ; and the filth of the necessari tub , into which the children often fell , and were almost suffoc . The shriek of the women , and the groan of the die , render the whole a scene of horror almost inconceiv . Happili perhap for myself I wa soon reduc so low here that it wa thought necessari to keep me almost alway on deck ; and from my extrem youth I wa not put in fetter . In thi situat I expect everi hour to share the fate of my companion , some of whom were almost daili brought upon deck at the point of death , which I began to hope would soon put an end to my miseri . Often did I think mani of the inhabit of the deep much more happi than myself . I envi them the freedom they enjoy , and as often wish I could chang my condit for their . Everi circumst I met with serv onli to render my state more pain , and heighten my apprehens , and my opinion of the cruelti of the white . One day they had taken a number of fish ; and when they had kill and satisfi themselv with as mani as they thought fit , to our astonish who were on the deck , rather than give ani of them to us to eat as we expect , they toss the remain fish into the sea again , although we beg and pray for some as well as we could , but in vain ; and some of my countrymen , be press by hunger , took an opportun , when they thought no one saw them , of tri to get a littl privat ; but they were discov , and the attempt procur them some veri sever flog . One day , when we had a smooth sea and moder wind , two of my weari countrymen who were chain togeth ( I wa near them at the time ) , prefer death to such a life of miseri , somehow made through the net and jump into the sea : immedi anoth quit deject fellow , who , on account of hi ill , wa suffer to be out of iron , also follow their exampl ; and I believ mani more would veri soon have done the same if they had not been prevent by the ship 's crew , who were instantli alarm . Those of us that were the most activ were in a moment put down under the deck , and there wa such a nois and confus amongst the peopl of the ship as I never heard befor , to stop her , and get the boat out to go after the slave . Howev two of the wretch were drown , but they got the other , and afterward flog him unmerci for thu attempt to prefer death to slaveri . In thi manner we continu to undergo more hardship than I can now relat , hardship which are insepar from thi accurs trade . Mani a time we were near suffoc from the want of fresh air , which we were often without for whole day togeth . Thi , and the stench of the necessari tub , carri off mani . Dure our passag I first saw fli fish , which surpris me veri much : they use frequent to fli across the ship , and mani of them fell on the deck . I also now first saw the use of the quadrant ; I had often with astonish seen the marin make observ with it , and I could not think what it meant . They at last took notic of my surpris ; and one of them , will to increas it , as well as to gratifi my curios , made me one day look through it . The cloud appear to me to be land , which disappear as they pass along . Thi heighten my wonder ; and I wa now more persuad than ever that I wa in anoth world , and that everi thing about me wa magic . At last we came in sight of the island of Barbado , at which the white on board gave a great shout , and made mani sign of joy to us . We did not know what to think of thi ; but as the vessel drew nearer we plainli saw the harbour , and other ship of differ kind and size ; and we soon anchor amongst them off Bridg Town . Mani merchant and planter now came on board , though it wa in the even . They put us in separ parcel , and examin us attent . They also made us jump , and point to the land , signifi we were to go there . We thought by thi we should be eaten by these ugli men , as they appear to us ; and , when soon after we were all put down under the deck again , there wa much dread and trembl among us , and noth but bitter cri to be heard all the night from these apprehens , insomuch that at last the white peopl got some old slave from the land to pacifi us . They told us we were not to be eaten , but to work , and were soon to go on land , where we should see mani of our countri peopl . Thi report eas us much ; and sure enough , soon after we were land , there came to us African of all languag . We were conduct immedi to the merchant 's yard , where we were all pent up togeth like so mani sheep in a fold , without regard to sex or age . As everi object wa new to me everi thing I saw fill me with surpris . What struck me first wa that the hous were built with stori , and in everi other respect differ from those in Africa : but I wa still more astonish on see peopl on horseback . I did not know what thi could mean ; and inde I thought these peopl were full of noth but magic art . While I wa in thi astonish one of my fellow prison spoke to a countryman of hi about the hors , who said they were the same kind they had in their countri . I understood them , though they were from a distant part of Africa , and I thought it odd I had not seen ani hors there ; but afterward , when I came to convers with differ African , I found they had mani hors amongst them , and much larger than those I then saw . We were not mani day in the merchant 's custodi befor we were sold after their usual manner , which is thi : -- On a signal given , ( as the beat of a drum ) the buyer rush at onc into the yard where the slave are confin , and make choic of that parcel they like best . The nois and clamour with which thi is attend , and the eager visibl in the counten of the buyer , serv not a littl to increas the apprehens of the terrifi African , who may well be suppos to consid them as the minist of that destruct to which they think themselv devot . In thi manner , without scrupl , are relat and friend separ , most of them never to see each other again . I rememb in the vessel in which I wa brought over , in the men 's apart , there were sever brother , who , in the sale , were sold in differ lot ; and it wa veri move on thi occas to see and hear their cri at part . O , ye nomin Christian ! might not an African ask you , learn you thi from your God , who say unto you , Do unto all men as you would men should do unto you ? Is it not enough that we are torn from our countri and friend to toil for your luxuri and lust of gain ? Must everi tender feel be likewis sacrif to your avaric ? Are the dearest friend and relat , now render more dear by their separ from their kindr , still to be part from each other , and thu prevent from cheer the gloom of slaveri with the small comfort of be togeth and mingl their suffer and sorrow ? Whi are parent to lose their children , brother their sister , or husband their wive ? Sure thi is a new refin in cruelti , which , while it ha no advantag to aton for it , thu aggrav distress , and add fresh horror even to the wretched of slaveri .
Thu , at the moment I expect all my toil to end , wa I plung , as I suppos , in a new slaveri ; in comparison of which all my servic hitherto had been 'perfect freedom ; ' and whose horror , alway present to my mind , now rush on it with tenfold aggrav . I wept veri bitterli for some time : and began to think that I must have done someth to displeas the Lord , that he thu punish me so sever . Thi fill me with pain reflect on my past conduct ; I recollect that on the morn of our arriv at Deptford I had rashli sworn that as soon as we reach London I would spend the day in rambl and sport . My conscienc smote me for thi unguard express : I felt that the Lord wa abl to disappoint me in all thing , and immedi consid my present situat as a judgment of Heaven on account of my presumpt in swear : I therefor , with contrit of heart , acknowledg my transgress to God , and pour out my soul befor him with unfeign repent , and with earnest supplic I besought him not to me in my distress , nor cast me from hi merci for ever . In a littl time my grief , spent with it own violenc , began to subsid ; and after the first confus of my thought wa over I reflect with more calm on my present condit : I consid that trial and disappoint are sometim for our good , and I thought God might perhap have permit thi in order to teach me wisdom and resign ; for he had hitherto shadow me with the wing of hi merci , and by hi invis but power hand brought me the way I knew not . These reflect gave me a littl comfort , and I rose at last from the deck with deject and sorrow in my counten , yet mix with some faint hope that the Lord would appear for my deliver .
On the second day of our voyag we came to an island call Obbico , the largest of the Bahama island . We were much in want of water ; for by thi time our water wa expend , and we were exceedingli fatigu in pull two day in the heat of the sun ; and it be late in the even , we haul the boat ashor to tri for water and remain dure the night : when we came ashor we search for water , but could find none . When it wa dark , we made a fire around us for fear of the wild beast , as the place wa an entir thick wood , and we took it by turn to watch . In thi situat we found veri littl rest , and wait with impati for the morn . As soon as the light appear we set off again with our boat , in hope of find assist dure the day . We were now much deject and weaken by pull the boat ; for our sail wa of no use , and we were almost famish for want of fresh water to drink . We had noth left to eat but salt beef , and that we could not use without water . In thi situat we toil all day in sight of the island , which wa veri long ; in the even , see no relief , we made ashor again , and fasten our boat . We then went to look for fresh water , be quit faint for the want of it ; and we dug and search about for some all the remaind of the even , but could not find one drop , so that our deject at thi period becam excess , and our terror so great , that we expect noth but death to deliv us . We could not touch our beef , which wa as salt as brine , without fresh water ; and we were in the greatest terror from the apprehens of wild beast . When unwelcom night came we act as on the night befor ; and the next morn we set off again from the island in hope of see some vessel . In thi manner we toil as well as we were abl till four o'clock , dure which we pass sever key , but could not meet with a ship ; and , still famish with thirst , went ashor on one of those key again in hope of find some water . Here we found some leav with a few drop of water in them , which we lap with much eager ; we then dug in sever place , but without success . As we were dig hole in search of water there came forth some veri thick and black stuff ; but none of us could touch it , except the poor Dutch Creol , who drank abov a quart of it as eagerli as if it had been wine . We tri to catch fish , but could not ; and we now began to repin at our fate , and ourselv to despair ; when , in the midst of our murmur , the captain all at onc cri out 'A sail ! a sail ! a sail ! ' Thi gladden sound wa like a repriev to a convict , and we all instantli turn to look at it ; but in a littl time some of us began to be afraid it wa not a sail . Howev , at a ventur , we embark and steer after it ; and , in half an hour , to our unspeak joy , we plainli saw that it wa a vessel . At thi our droop spirit reviv , and we made toward her with all the speed imagin . When we came near to her , we found she wa a littl sloop , about the size of a Gravesend hoy , and quit full of peopl ; a circumst which we could not make out the mean of . Our captain , who wa a Welchman , swore that they were pirat , and would kill us . I said , be that as it might , we must board her if we were to die for it ; and , if they should not receiv us kindli , we must oppos them as well as we could ; for there wa no altern between their perish and our . Thi counsel wa immedi taken ; and I realli believ that the captain , myself , and the Dutchman , would then have face twenti men . We had two cutlass and a musquet , that I brought in the boat ; and , in thi situat , we row alongsid , and immedi board her . I believ there were about forti hand on board ; but how great wa our surpris , as soon as we got on board , to find that the major part of them were in the same predica as ourselv !
Look how that beast to fel hath relap 'd From have lost correct of the spur , Sinc to the bridl thou hast set thine hand , O German Albert ! who 'st her , That is grown savag and unmanag , When thou should'st clasp her flank with fork heel . Just judgment from the star fall on thi blood ! And be it strang and manifest to all ! Such as may strike thi successor with dread ! For that thi sire and thou have suffer 'd thu , Through greedi of yonder realm detain 'd , The garden of the empir to run wast . Come see the Capulet and Montagu , The Philippeschi and Monaldi ! man Who car'st for nought ! those sunk in grief , and these With dire suspicion rack 'd . Come , cruel one ! Come and behold the ' oppress of the nobl , And mark their injuri : and thou mayst see . What safeti Santafior can suppli . Come and behold thi Rome , who call on thee , Desol widow ! day and night with moan : `` My Caesar , whi dost thou desert my side ? '' Come and behold what love among thi peopl : And if no piti touch thee for us , Come and blush for thine own report . For me , If it be law , O Almighti Power , Who wast in earth for our sake crucifi ! Are thi just eye turn 'd elsewher ? or is thi A prepar in the wond'rou depth Of thi sage counsel made , for some good end , Entir from our reach of thought cut off ? So are the ' Italian citi all o'erthrong 'd With tyrant , and a great Marcellu made Of everi petti factiou villag .
`` I appreci your kind . If you can not assist me , you may recommend me to an agent whom I will employ . I notic that you refer in the letter to the name of my correspond , Mrs. Gordon ; the inquiri is of a delic natur , and it may be her wish that her name is not too freeli mention -- at all event , for the present . Her stori is not an uncommon one , but it take an extraordinari and unusu turn . She is now , accord to her own account , a ladi of consider mean ; her husband ha late die , and she ha come into a fortun . Some twenti odd year ago she wa a young woman , and had two lover , one of whom woo her with dishonour intent , and by him she wa betray . Thi occur dure the absenc in Australia of the gentleman who had propos to her , and whom she had accept . He wa a resid in Australia , and it wa hi intent to make hi home there . While he wa on hi way to England , with the intent of make her hi wife and return with her to the coloni , she discov that she wa about to becom a mother . In despair she fled from London , where he expect to find her , and sought to hide her shame among stranger . The place she select wa Portsmouth , and there she went through a seri of harrow trial , and wa reduc to extrem poverti . In her letter to me she make no effort to disguis the miseri into which she wa plung , and she is frank and outspoken in order that I may properli understand how it wa that she wa forc to the child that wa born in Portsmouth under most distress circumst . For it appear that when the suitor who woo her honour arriv in London and learn the stori of her betray , he wa still desir to make her hi wife . He trace her to Portsmouth , and found her there with her babe , who wa then but a few day old . Thi would have induc most men to forego their honour intent ; but Mr. Gordon , whose name she now bear , wa an except to the rule , and , through a gentleman who act as a go-between , he made a singular proposit to her . It wa to the effect that she should consent to give up her child entir , and dure hi lifetim to make no effort to recov it ; he undertook to find a respect and comfort home for the babe , and to make a liber provis for it . Thi is the bare outlin of hi proposit , and I need not go further into it . So desper wa her posit that she and her child at the time were liter starv ; she had not a friend but Mr. Gordon , who wa stern in hi resolv not to befriend her unless she accept the condit he dictat ; the gentleman who act as a go-between had behav veri kindli to her , but could not assist her further . In these circumst she made the sacrific , and part with her child , who from that day to thi she ha never seen . Mr. Gordon honour fulfil the term of the agreement ; a home wa found for the child , and he marri the ladi , and took her to Australia , where she ha resid for the last twenti year . It wa part of the agreement that she should not be inform of the name of the peopl who adopt the child , and should not , directli or indirectli , make the least endeavour to obtain ani inform concern it while her husband wa aliv . If he die befor her she wa free to act as she pleas in the matter . Thi ha occur , and the widow , who ha had no children by her marriag , is bent upon recov her child , who , I may mention , is a girl . The task is beset with difficulti , and may prove hopeless . Shortli state , Mr. Cohen , thi is the case as it at present stand . ''
I took a like for Louisa . For nearli a year I had born with the frigid of Sarah and her tyranni , `` You shall onli do it onc , -- I wo n't , -- I ca n't wait , -- well go , '' were command I had got accustom to obey , had bow to refus to allow her secret charm to be look at time after time , to have my prick eject befor the last inject throb had been given . I like the woman , dote on her exquisit form , like the domest of sit and read to her , and at the same time just feel her cunt whilst she laid on the sofa , becaus I like her convers , and becaus I wa at time reward by raptur delight when she herself bodi and soul to me , I submit to all thi . But I often rebel , wish it wa otherwis , and made up my mind to leav her for other women , yet did not . I have said all thi befor .
But I have one want which I have never yet been abl to satisfi , and the absenc of the object of which I now feel as a most sever evil , I have no friend , Margaret : when I am glow with the enthusiasm of success , there will be none to particip my joy ; if I am assail by disappoint , no one will endeavour to sustain me in deject . I shall commit my thought to paper , it is true ; but that is a poor medium for the commun of feel . I desir the compani of a man who could sympath with me , whose eye would repli to mine . You may deem me romant , my dear sister , but I bitterli feel the want of a friend . I have no one near me , gentl yet courag , possess of a cultiv as well as of a capaci mind , whose tast are like my own , to approv or amend my plan . How would such a friend repair the fault of your poor brother ! I am too ardent in execut and too impati of difficulti . But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educ : for the first fourteen year of my life I ran wild on a common and read noth but our Uncl Thoma ' book of voyag . At that age I becam acquaint with the celebr poet of our own countri ; but it wa onli when it had ceas to be in my power to deriv it most import benefit from such a convict that I perceiv the necess of becom acquaint with more languag than that of my nativ countri . Now I am twenty-eight and am in realiti more illiter than mani schoolboy of fifteen . It is true that I have thought more and that my daydream are more extend and magnific , but they want ( as the painter call it ) KEEP ; and I greatli need a friend who would have sens enough not to despis me as romant , and affect enough for me to endeavour to regul my mind . Well , these are useless complaint ; I shall certainli find no friend on the wide ocean , nor even here in Archangel , among merchant and seamen . Yet some feel , unal to the dross of human natur , beat even in these rug bosom . My lieuten , for instanc , is a man of wonder courag and enterpris ; he is madli desir of glori , or rather , to word my phrase more characterist , of advanc in hi profess . He is an Englishman , and in the midst of nation and profession prejudic , unsoften by cultiv , retain some of the noblest endow of human . I first becam acquaint with him on board a whale vessel ; find that he wa unemploy in thi citi , I easili engag him to assist in my enterpris . The master is a person of an excel disposit and is remark in the ship for hi gentl and the mild of hi disciplin . Thi circumst , ad to hi well-known integr and dauntless courag , made me veri desir to engag him . A youth pass in solitud , my best year spent under your gentl and feminin fosterag , ha so refin the groundwork of my charact that I can not overcom an intens distast to the usual brutal exercis on board ship : I have never believ it to be necessari , and when I heard of a marin equal note for hi kindli of heart and the respect and obedi paid to him by hi crew , I felt myself peculiarli fortun in be abl to secur hi servic . I heard of him first in rather a romant manner , from a ladi who owe to him the happi of her life . Thi , briefli , is hi stori . Some year ago he love a young Russian ladi of moder fortun , and have amass a consider sum in prize-money , the father of the girl consent to the match . He saw hi mistress onc befor the destin ceremoni ; but she wa bath in tear , and throw herself at hi feet , entreat him to spare her , confess at the same time that she love anoth , but that he wa poor , and that her father would never consent to the union . My gener friend reassur the suppliant , and on be inform of the name of her lover , instantli hi pursuit . He had alreadi bought a farm with hi money , on which he had design to pass the remaind of hi life ; but he bestow the whole on hi rival , togeth with the remain of hi prize-money to purchas stock , and then himself solicit the young woman 's father to consent to her marriag with her lover . But the old man decidedli refus , think himself bound in honour to my friend , who , when he found the father inexor , quit hi countri , nor return until he heard that hi former mistress wa marri accord to her inclin . `` What a nobl fellow ! '' you will exclaim . He is so ; but then he is wholli uneduc : he is as silent as a Turk , and a kind of ignor careless attend him , which , while it render hi conduct the more astonish , detract from the interest and sympathi which otherwis he would command .
`` How can I move thee ? Will no entreati caus thee to turn a favour eye upon thi creatur , who implor thi good and compass ? Believ me , Frankenstein , I wa benevol ; my soul glow with love and human ; but am I not alon , miser alon ? You , my creator , abhor me ; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatur , who owe me noth ? They spurn and hate me . The desert mountain and dreari glacier are my refug . I have wander here mani day ; the cave of ice , which I onli do not fear , are a dwell to me , and the onli one which man doe not grudg .

But now , when I appear almost within grasp of my foe , my hope were suddenli extinguish , and I lost all trace of him more utterli than I had ever done befor . A ground sea wa heard ; the thunder of it progress , as the water roll and swell beneath me , becam everi moment more omin and terrif . I press on , but in vain . The wind aros ; the sea roar ; and , as with the mighti shock of an earthquak , it split and crack with a tremend and overwhelm sound . The work wa soon finish ; in a few minut a tumultu sea roll between me and my enemi , and I wa left drift on a scatter piec of ice that wa continu lessen and thu prepar for me a hideou death . In thi manner mani appal hour pass ; sever of my dog die , and I myself wa about to sink under the accumul of distress when I saw your vessel ride at anchor and hold forth to me hope of succour and life . I had no concept that vessel ever came so far north and wa astound at the sight . I quickli destroy part of my sledg to construct oar , and by these mean wa enabl , with infinit fatigu , to move my ice raft in the direct of your ship . I had determin , if you were go southward , still to trust myself to the merci of the sea rather than my purpos . I hope to induc you to grant me a boat with which I could pursu my enemi . But your direct wa northward . You took me on board when my vigour wa exhaust , and I should soon have sunk under my multipli hardship into a death which I still dread , for my task is unfulfil .

He remain , therefor , in hi seat near the window , read and write , and express in as mani pleasant and natur way as he could think of , that it wa a free place .
`` My dear Mr. Lorri , it is becaus I am a Frenchman born , that the thought ( which I did not mean to utter here , howev ) ha pass through my mind often . One can not help think , have had some sympathi for the miser peopl , and have someth to them , '' he spoke here in hi former thought manner , `` that one might be listen to , and might have the power to persuad to some restraint .

`` When Dr. Roylott wa in India he marri my mother , Mrs. Stoner , the young widow of Major-Gener Stoner , of the Bengal Artilleri . My sister Julia and I were twin , and we were onli two year old at the time of my mother 's re-marriag . She had a consider sum of money -- not less than 1000 pound a year -- and thi she bequeath to Dr. Roylott entir while we resid with him , with a provis that a certain annual sum should be allow to each of us in the event of our marriag . Shortli after our return to England my mother die -- she wa kill eight year ago in a railway accid near Crew . Dr. Roylott then hi attempt to establish himself in practic in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestr hous at Stoke Moran . The money which my mother had left wa enough for all our want , and there seem to be no obstacl to our happi .
It wa in the summer of '89 , not long after my marriag , that the event occur which I am now about to summaris . I had return to civil practic and had final Holm in hi Baker Street room , although I continu visit him and occasion even persuad him to forgo hi Bohemian habit so far as to come and visit us . My practic had steadili increas , and as I happen to live at no veri great distanc from Paddington Station , I got a few patient from among the offici . One of these , whom I had cure of a pain and linger diseas , wa never weari of advertis my virtu and of endeavour to send me on everi suffer over whom he might have ani influenc .
`` It 's got to go '' , shout hi sister , `` that 's the onli way , Father . You 've got to get rid of the idea that that 's Gregor . We 've onli harm ourselv by believ it for so long . How can that be Gregor ? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it 's not possibl for human be to live with an anim like that and he would have gone of hi own free will . We would n't have a brother ani more , then , but we could carri on with our live and rememb him with respect . As it is thi anim is persecut us , it 's driven out our tenant , it obvious want to take over the whole flat and forc us to sleep on the street . Father , look , just look '' , she suddenli scream , `` he 's start again ! '' In her alarm , which wa total beyond Gregor 's comprehens , hi sister even hi mother as she push herself vigor out of her chair as if more will to sacrific her own mother than stay anywher near Gregor . She rush over to behind her father , who had becom excit mere becaus she wa and stood up half rais hi hand in front of Gregor 's sister as if to protect her .
`` You are not Amalia Ivanovna , but Amalia Ludwigovna , and as I am not one of your despic flatter like Mr. Lebeziatnikov , who 's laugh behind the door at thi moment ( a laugh and a cri of 'they are at it again ' wa in fact audibl at the door ) so I shall alway call you Amalia Ludwigovna , though I fail to understand whi you dislik that name . You can see for yourself what ha happen to Semyon Zaharovitch ; he is die . I beg you to close that door at onc and to admit no one . Let him at least die in peac ! Or I warn you the Governor-Gener , himself , shall be inform of your conduct to-morrow . The princ knew me as a girl ; he rememb Semyon Zaharovitch well and ha often been a benefactor to him . Everyon know that Semyon Zaharovitch had mani friend and protector , whom he himself from an honour pride , know hi unhappi weak , but now ( she point to Raskolnikov ) a gener young man ha come to our assist , who ha wealth and connect and whom Semyon Zaharovitch ha known from a child .

`` Well , if he 's proud of it , he ha reason , I do n't deni it . You seem to be offend , sister , at my make onli such a frivol critic on the letter , and to think that I speak of such trifl matter on purpos to annoy you . It is quit the contrari , an observ apropo of the style occur to me that is by no mean irrelev as thing stand . There is one express , 'blame yourselv ' put in veri significantli and plainli , and there is besid a threat that he will go away at onc if I am present . That threat to go away is equival to a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedi , and to you now after summon you to Petersburg . Well , what do you think ? Can one resent such an express from Luzhin , as we should if he ( he point to Razumihin ) had written it , or Zossimov , or one of us ? ''
`` Good heaven , how doe he know who kill Lizaveta ? What did those word mean ? It 's aw !

It 's a duti of everi man to work for enlighten and propaganda and the more harshli , perhap , the better . I might drop a seed , an idea ... . And someth might grow up from that seed . How should I be insult them ? They might be offend at first , but afterward they 'd see I 'd done them a servic . You know , Terebyeva ( who is in the commun now ) wa blame becaus when she left her famili and ... devot ... herself , she wrote to her father and mother that she would n't go on live convent and wa enter on a free marriag and it wa said that that wa too harsh , that she might have spare them and have written more kindli . I think that 's all nonsens and there 's no need of soft ; on the contrari , what 's want is protest . Varent had been marri seven year , she her two children , she told her husband straight out in a letter : 'I have realis that I can not be happi with you . I can never forgiv you that you have deceiv me by conceal from me that there is anoth organis of societi by mean of the commun . I have onli late learn it from a great-heart man to whom I have given myself and with whom I am establish a commun . I speak plainli becaus I consid it dishonest to deceiv you .

Onli fanci , she rush off there , to the other gener 's , and , imagin , she wa so persist that she manag to get the chief to see her , had him fetch out from dinner , it seem . You can imagin what happen . She wa turn out , of cours ; but , accord to her own stori , she abus him and threw someth at him . One may well believ it ... . How it is she wa n't taken up , I ca n't understand ! Now she is tell everyon , includ Amalia Ivanovna ; but it 's difficult to understand her , she is scream and fling herself about ... . Oh ye , she shout that sinc everyon ha her , she will take the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ , and the children will sing and danc , and she too , and collect money , and will go everi day under the gener 's window ...
